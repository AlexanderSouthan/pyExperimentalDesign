# pyExperimentalDesign

Class for the analysis of data obtained from a design of experiments approach. It does aim to re-invent the relevant, individual methods already implemented in SciPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn etc., but rather to provide an easy to use module that does some data preprocessing and is a collection of the most useful methods from the external packages. 

## Installation
Download and run the following command from the repository folder might work,
I have not tested it, yet.
```
pip install -e .
```
